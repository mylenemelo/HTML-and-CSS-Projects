# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository contains my HTML and CSS projects for the Version Control course at Durham College.

Each project will show what I learned about:
- HTML structure and tags
- CSS styling and layouts
- Responsive design techniques

## Purpose
This repository helps me practice web design skills and track my progress throughout the course.
